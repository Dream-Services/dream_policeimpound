![Dream Policeimpound](https://i.imgur.com/LQb9K38.jpg)

**Dream Police Impound** is a lightweight yet powerful impound system for FiveM servers, giving law enforcement full control over vehicle impounds.  

**💸 Price:** Just like our [holiday script](https://github.com/Dream-Services/dream_christmas), this one is completely **free**! Every server deserves quality features without extra costs. 🚓✨  

## Features  
### `🦖` **| Easy Impounding**  
Officers can impound vehicles effortlessly using a simple targeting system on any vehicle. This streamlines the process, ensuring quick and efficient vehicle management.  

### `📆` **| Minimum Duration**  
Set a mandatory impound duration before vehicles can be released. This ensures balanced enforcement and prevents immediate retrieval.  

### `💰` **| Customizable Penalties**  
Configure predefined fines or allow custom penalty amounts for each impound, giving flexibility to match server rules and roleplay scenarios.  

### `📝` **| Officer Notes**  
Officers can add notes when impounding vehicles, providing important context for future reference and ensuring better coordination.  

### `🔒` **| Secure Release**  
Vehicles can only be released by an authorized officer, adding an extra layer of security. This feature can be toggled dynamically based on server preferences.  

### `⚙️` **| Fully Configurable**  
Every aspect of the system, from impound durations to penalty structures, can be customized in the config file to perfectly fit your server’s needs.
